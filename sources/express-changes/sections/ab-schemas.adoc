== Schemas

=== General

This annex provides the YAML Schema definitions for the EXPRESS Changes YAML
formats defined in this document.

These schemas can be used to validate EXPRESS Changes YAML files and to
generate documentation or tooling for working with EXPRESS change records.

The schemas are defined in YAML Schema format that follows the JSON Schema
format (draft-07).

The schema change schema defines the structure for recording modifications to
EXPRESS schema structure across versions, as described in <<schema-change>>.

This schema can be used for validation by prefixing an EXPRESS Changes YAML
file with the following comment line:

[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.expresslang.org/schemas/changes/v1/schema_changes.yaml
----

=== Mapping change schema

The mapping change schema defines the structure for recording modifications to
EXPRESS schema mappings across versions, as described in <<mapping-change>>.

This schema can be used for validation by prefixing an EXPRESS Changes YAML
file with the following comment line:
