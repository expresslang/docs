== Structure

An EXPRESS Changes document is a YAML file that records changes made to an
EXPRESS schema across different editions or versions.

There are two kinds of changes:

* Schema changes
* Mapping changes

The top-level structure of an EXPRESS Changes document has the following
specification.

[source,yaml]
----
schema: String (required)
  # Name of the EXPRESS schema
editions:
  - version: String (required)
    # Version number for this change edition
    description: String (optional)
    # Description of changes in this edition
    {type_of_change}:
      - description: String (required)
        # Description of the change
        # ... additional fields depending on type_of_change
----

Fields:

`schema`:: The name of the EXPRESS schema (string) (required).
+
[example]
`support_resource_schema`

`editions`:: An array of edition change objects (required).

`type_of_change`:: One of `additions`, `modifications`, `removals`, or
`mapping`.
