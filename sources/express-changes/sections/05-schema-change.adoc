== Schema change

=== General

The schema change structure captures modifications to the structure and
semantics of an EXPRESS schema across different editions or versions. It
captures additions, modifications, and removals of schema elements such as
entities, types, functions, and rules.

The structure is built on the following constructs:

* Edition changes: Each edition or version of the schema, detailing what
changed.

* Item changes: Specific elements that were added, modified, or removed in an
edition.

Syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
schema: String (required)
  # Name of the EXPRESS schema
editions:
  - {edition change 1}
  - {edition change 2}
----


=== Edition change

Each edition change represents a specific version of the schema and details
the changes made in that version.

Syntax:

[source,yaml]
