== Content syntax

=== General

Annotated EXPRESS (in its current form) accepts Metanorma AsciiDoc.
The syntax of Metanorma AsciiDoc is described at https://www.metanorma.org.

There are several extensions to Metanorma AsciiDoc for the documentation of
EXPRESS.

=== EXPRESS object cross-references

In Annotated EXPRESS remark content, it is often necessary to cross-reference
other EXPRESS objects.

In the generated EXPRESS documentation, these references become links to the
definition of the target EXPRESS objects.

The syntax is:

[source]
----
<<express:{TAG}>>
----

or

[source]
----
<<express:{TAG},{RENDER TEXT}>>
----

Where:

* `{TAG}` is the EXPRESS named tag, e.g. `action_schema.action_method`
* `{RENDER TEXT}` is the desired rendering text, if different from the named tag,
  e.g. `action methods`
