== Introduction

Annotated EXPRESS is a set of rules that build on top of the EXPRESS remark tag
syntax for documentation and description of EXPRESS code. It can be considered
in the same category of Doxygen for C, JavaDoc for Java, RubyDoc for Ruby.

EXPRESS is a data modelling language offered in a code-like syntax.

As in typical source code, you can insert comments that do not get parsed or
interpreted by the compiler. For example, in C, block comments are realized with
`/* ... */`.

In EXPRESS, the remark tag syntax is `(* ... *)`, indicating that anything in
the `...` is considered documentation.

Annotated EXPRESS accepts Metanorma AsciiDoc as content.
