== Introduction

=== General

The EXPRESS mapping language is a domain-specific language designed to express
reference paths between entities in a set of EXPRESS schemas.

It provides a formal syntax and semantics for specifying how entities in one schema
relate to entities in another schema through a series of navigations. These paths
can include subtype and supertype relationships, forward and inverse attribute
navigations, and constraints on entity attributes.

The operators and syntax to express allow for these navigations to be defined
precisely and unambiguously.

The mapping language serves several purposes:

Documentation:: Provides a clear, machine-readable specification of how concepts
of a conceptual model described in EXPRESS maps to an implementation described
in another EXPRESS schema.

Validation:: Enables automated validation that mapping paths are correct and
traverse valid relationships in the EXPRESS schema.

Interoperability:: Ensures consistent interpretation of mappings across
different tools and implementations.

Maintenance:: Facilitates detection of broken mappings when schemas evolve.

=== Historical context

In ISO 10303 (STEP), requirements of the application modules are defined using
Application Resource Models (ARMs) expressed in EXPRESS.

The implementation of these requirements is defined using Module Interpreted
Models (MIMs), also expressed in EXPRESS.

The EXPRESS mapping language was developed to formally express the relationships
between ARM entities and MIM entities.
