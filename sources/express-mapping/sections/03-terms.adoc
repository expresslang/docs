== Terms and definitions

=== application resource model
preferred:[ARM]

conceptual model that represents application domain concepts in a neutral,
implementation-independent manner

[.source]
<<ISO10303-2>>

=== module interpreted model
preferred:[MIM]

implementation model that maps ARM concepts to EXPRESS constructs using entities
and relationships from integrated resources

[.source]
<<ISO10303-2>>

=== reference path

sequence of navigation steps through EXPRESS schema entity relationships,
expressing how an entity in one schema relates to an entity in another schema

=== subtype relationship

relationship where one entity inherits all attributes and constraints from
another entity, expressed in EXPRESS with the SUBTYPE OF construct

=== supertype relationship

relationship where an entity serves as a base type for one or more subtypes,
providing attributes and constraints inherited by those subtypes

=== forward attribute navigation

navigation that follows an attribute from an entity to the entity it references

[example]
Navigating from `product_definition` through attribute `formation` to
`product_definition_formation`.

=== inverse attribute navigation

navigation that finds entities referencing the current entity through a specific
attribute

[example]
Finding all `product_definition_relationship` entities that reference a
`product_definition` through their `related_product_definition` attribute.

=== constraint block

expression that specifies conditions that entities or attributes must satisfy
during path navigation

[example]
`{product_definition_relationship.name = 'definition usage'}` requires the
`name` attribute to equal the specified string value.

=== navigation step

single element in a reference path representing one traversal operation
(subtype, supertype, forward navigation, or inverse navigation)

=== path expression

complete reference path from one schema entity to another schema entity,
composed of at least one navigation step
