== Principles

=== Pretty printing

Pretty printing is the systematic formatting of source code according to
predefined rules to enhance readability, maintainability, and consistency.

The practice of pretty printing is common in programming languages and
software development. It involves organizing code into a structured format
that is easy to read and understand. This includes consistent indentation,
line breaks, and spacing, as well as the use of meaningful names for
variables, functions, and other constructs. Pretty printing also helps
identify syntax errors and improve the overall quality of the code.

Pretty printing is particularly important in the context of data modeling
and schema definition languages like EXPRESS. In these languages, the
structure and semantics of the data models are defined through a series of
declarations, expressions, and statements. A well-formatted schema makes
it easier for developers, data architects, and other stakeholders to
understand the relationships between different entities, types, and
attributes. It also aids in the maintenance and evolution of the schema
over time, as changes can be made more easily when the code is organized
and readable.


=== EXPRESS pretty printing

In the context of the EXPRESS language, pretty printing refers to the
formatting of EXPRESS schemas, entities, types, functions, rules, and other
declarations to ensure that they are presented in a consistent and readable
manner. This is particularly important for human readers who need to
understand the structure and semantics of the data models defined in
EXPRESS.

This document is developed based on EXPRESS formatting rules described in the
following references:

* the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplementary Directives TC 184/SC 4 N2412 and its later
versions

* the Express Engine development guide for its Pretty Printer, where it covers
formatting rules beyond the scope of the SC4 Supplementary Directives

NOTE: The rules specified in this document were originally developed by the
Express Engine team to fill a gap in the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplementary
Directives. While the Supplementary Directives document (TC 184/SC 4 N2412) and
its subsequent versions provide some guidance on EXPRESS schema formatting, they
do not comprehensively address the layout of all EXPRESS constructs.

EXPRESS pretty printing involves the formatting of its various constructs,
covered by the three basic groups of objects:

* Declarations
* Expressions
* Statements
