== Introduction

The EXPRESS language, defined in ISO 10303-11, is widely used for data modeling
in product data exchange applications. A consistent, readable formatting of
EXPRESS schemas is crucial for human readers to understand the structure and
semantics of the data models.

Pretty printing refers to the systematic formatting of source code, in this
case EXPRESS schemas, to enhance readability, maintainability, and
consistency. A standardized pretty printing format ensures that all EXPRESS
schemas follow uniform layout rules, making them easier to read, understand,
and maintain across different implementations and applications.

The rules specified in this document were originally developed by the Express
Engine team to fill a gap in the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplementary Directives.
While the Supplementary Directives document (TC 184/SC 4 N2412) and its
subsequent versions provide some guidance on EXPRESS schema formatting, they
do not comprehensively address the layout of all EXPRESS constructs.

The pretty printing rules presented here explain how various EXPRESS constructs
should be formatted for presentation. The document provides references for the
formatting choices where possible, especially when they are derived from the
SC4 Supplementary Directives. Where the Directives do not specify formatting
rules, this document establishes consistent formatting patterns based on the
Express Engine implementation.

This standard addresses the layout of three basic groups of objects in EXPRESS:

* Declarations (schema, entity, type, function, etc.)
* Expressions (arithmetic, logical, relational, etc.)
* Statements (assignment, procedure calls, conditionals, etc.)

By following these rules, EXPRESS schema authors and tool developers can ensure
that their schemas are presented in a consistent, readable manner that aligns
with community practices.

This standard builds upon the significant contributions of the Express Engine
team, particularly the work of Craig Lanning and Thomas Thurman who authored the
original documentation of pretty printing rules for the EXPRESS language. The
EXPRESS community recognizes their valuable contributions to establishing
consistent and readable formatting for EXPRESS schemas.

While the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 had not previously defined comprehensive pretty
printing rules for EXPRESS, the Express Engine team contributed these rules to
the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplemental Directives. The EXPRESS Language Foundation has
adopted these rules as a formal standard to ensure consistent schema formatting
across the EXPRESS ecosystem.
