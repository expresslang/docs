== Scope

This document specifies rules for the presentation format (pretty printing) of
EXPRESS language schemas. It provides a standardized approach to formatting
various elements of the EXPRESS language, including declarations, expressions,
and statements.

The rules specified in this document apply to all EXPRESS schemas, regardless
of their application domain. The standardized pretty printing format enhances
readability, improves maintainability, and ensures consistency across EXPRESS
implementations.

This document provides test cases and examples to illustrate the formatting rules
and their application to different EXPRESS constructs, and can be used
by a EXPRESS pretty printer to claim conformance to this standard.

This document is intended for:

* EXPRESS schema authors who wish to format their schemas in a consistent,
readable manner
* Tool developers implementing pretty printing capabilities for EXPRESS schemas
* Reviewers and users of EXPRESS schemas who benefit from consistently formatted
schemas

The pretty printing rules specified here complement the syntax and semantics of
the EXPRESS language as defined in ISO 10303-11.
