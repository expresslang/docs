== Introduction

The Metanorma ELF format provides a standardized approach for creating EXPRESS
language documentation using the Metanorma toolchain. This document describes
the process of converting existing EXPRESS documentation into the Annotated
EXPRESS format, which is the model-based method preferred for modern EXPRESS
documentation.

This guide is intended for document maintainers and developers who need to
migrate existing EXPRESS documentation to the standardized Annotated EXPRESS
format. The approach described here can be applied to PDF parts after converting
them into Metanorma.
