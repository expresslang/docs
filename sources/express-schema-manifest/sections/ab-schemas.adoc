== Schemas

=== General

This annex provides the YAML Schema definitions for the EXPRESS Schema Manifest YAML
format defined in this document.

This schema can be used to validate EXPRESS Schema Manifest YAML files and to
generate documentation or tooling for working with EXPRESS change records.

The schemas are defined in YAML Schema format that follows the JSON Schema
format (draft-07).

The schema change schema defines the structure for recording modifications to
EXPRESS schema structure across versions, as described in <<syntax>>.

YAML file with the following comment line:

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.expresslang.org/schemas/manifest/v1/schema_manifest.yaml
