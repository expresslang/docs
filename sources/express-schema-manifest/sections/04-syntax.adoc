== Syntax

=== General

The EXPRESS Schema Manifest is defined using YAML syntax. This section specifies
the structure and components of the manifest file.

=== General structure

The manifest file consists of two main components:

. An optional root path that serves as the base directory for all schemas
. A mandatory schema listings section that enumerates all EXPRESS schemas

The general structure of the manifest file is as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
---
path: ~/src/iso-10303-srl <1>
schemas: <2>
  # listing of EXPRESS schema names
  action_schema: <3>
    # `path`: per-schema relative path to the root path
    path: schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp <4>
  aic_associative_draughting_elements:
    path: schemas/resources/aic_associative_draughting_elements/aic_associative_draughting_elements.exp
  # ...
----
<1> (optional) Root path
<2> (mandatory)Schema listings
<3> (mandatory) Individual EXPRESS schema names
<4> (optional) Individual schema path


=== Components

==== Root path

The root path is an optional component that specifies the base directory for all
schemas listed in the manifest file.

* If not set, the current working directory is used as the root path.
* The root path can be an absolute path or a path that includes shell
  expansions like `~` for the home directory.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
path: ~/src/iso-10303-srl
----
====

==== Schema listings

The schema listings section is a mandatory component that enumerates all EXPRESS
schemas included in the manifest.

* Each schema is represented by a key-value pair where the key is the name of
  the EXPRESS schema.
* Each schema entry may include an optional path that specifies the location of
  the schema file relative to the root path.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
schemas:
  action_schema:
    path: schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp
  aic_associative_draughting_elements:
    path: schemas/resources/aic_associative_draughting_elements/aic_associative_draughting_elements.exp
----
====

==== Individual schema path

The individual schema path is an optional component that specifies the location
of a specific schema file.

* If not set, the schema is assumed to be located at
  `{root_path}/{schema_name}.exp` or `{current directory}/{schema_name}.exp` if
  no root path is specified.
* The path is relative to the root path if one is specified, or to the current
  working directory otherwise.

=== Usage patterns

==== When root path is current directory

When the root path is the current directory, individual schema paths must be
specified if they differ from the default pattern of `{schema_name}.exp`.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
schemas:
  action_schema:
    path: schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp
  aic_associative_draughting_elements:
    path: schemas/resources/aic_associative_draughting_elements/aic_associative_draughting_elements.exp
  # ...
----
====

==== When root path is specified

When a root path is specified and schemas are located at
`{root_path}/{schema_name}.exp`, individual schema paths can be omitted or set
to `nil`.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
path: ~/src/iso-10303-srl
schemas:
  action_schema: nil
  aic_associative_draughting_elements: nil
  # ...
----
====

==== When schema names do not match file names

When schema names do not match their file names, individual schema paths must be
specified.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
---
schemas:
  Event_arm:
    path: ../../schemas/modules/event/arm.exp
  Event_mim:
    path: ../../schemas/modules/event/mim.exp
  # ...

=== Example implementation

An example implementation of the EXPRESS Schema Manifest is provided in the
EXPRESSdocs framework.

[example]
====
The `schemas-srl.yml` file in the EXPRESSdocs repository provides a complete
example of an EXPRESS Schema Manifest.
