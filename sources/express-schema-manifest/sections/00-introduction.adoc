== Introduction

=== General

The EXPRESS Schema Manifest specification provides a standardized format for
listing and referencing multiple EXPRESS schemas within a project or system.
This specification addresses the need for a consistent way to organize and
reference EXPRESS schemas, particularly in the context of the EXPRESSdocs
framework.

EXPRESS schemas are fundamental components in data modeling for product data
representation and exchange. As projects grow in complexity, they often
incorporate multiple schemas that need to be referenced and managed
collectively. The EXPRESS Schema Manifest specification offers a solution to
this challenge by providing a structured format for schema listings.

=== Historical context

In STEPmod (developed by ISO/TC 184/SC 4), the `repository_index.xml` file
served the purpose of defining the SMRL (STEP Module Repository Library)
collection of EXPRESS schemas. This specification builds upon that concept,
providing a more flexible and modern approach using YAML syntax.

The current specification reflects the `schemas.yaml` file structure that is
used in EXPRESSdocs, offering a clear and maintainable way to reference multiple
EXPRESS schemas and their locations.
